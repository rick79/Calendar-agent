# Calendar agent

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

My AI project idea is an agentive program that reads my e-mail correspondence and automatically schedules meetings in my online calendar along with Teams/Skype meeting links and other relevant information. 


## Background

If your inbox quickly fills with meeting requests managing scheduling and booking of these meetings can quickly become a chore. Having an agentive AI program that reads my e-mail correspondence, automatically schedules meetings in my online calendar, creates Teams/Skype links and collects documents, agendas and other important information and invites other participants would help me with my work efficiency.



## How is it used?

The program takes it's form as a plug in for Outlook or similar e-mail and calendar applications. When installed and given access to the user's inbox and calendar it sifts through previous e-mail correspondence and calendar bookings to learn about it's user. When a new e-mail message arrives it tries to determine wether it should class the message as a booking request and schedule an appointment or if it should ignore it. The same goes for outgoing messages. When it finds something that it thinks should result in a calendar booking it asks the user wether it should do so or not. After a while it will have learned enough to be able to pÂ´operate more or less autonomously requiring less and less interaction from the user.



## Data sources and AI methods
The data used comes from either a preinstalled baseline based on different languages or data collected from the user. The data is used to buld a model for classifying a message as a booking request or not, and to extract important information about the booking such as day and time, agenda, participants and document attatchments that should be inckluded in the booking.

The main source of data will be e-mail messages.

AI methods that could be used are Natural Language Processing methods such as Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency that can classify messages based on the words in them and identify important sections of the message that contains informations such as dates and times, participants and agendas.



## Challenges

The biggest challenge would be to get users to trust the system enough to use it. The technology for classifying texts and extracting information have been around for quite a while and have been used for many applications. As long as the AI program is not used for manageing calendar bookings in a sensitive context there should be few if any ethical considerations other personal information integrity. The AI program could manage this consideration by not having any information about the e-mail messages, bookings or anything else leave the user's device in any other means than through making said bookings in the online calendar system.

The AI program should not be used in sensitive or classified contexts such as for doctors appointments or if the information containd in the user's e-mails could contain sensitive or classified information.



## What next?

The skills needed to create the AI program are data science/AI development, application development for the e-mail/calendar platforms and interaction design for the sysem-user interaction.
